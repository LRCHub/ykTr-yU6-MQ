Silence please now
I don't want a word
Got deep in trouble
And my hands got burnt

Ain't nobody love me
That's how I got here
With pockets full of nothing
And a head full of fear

You broke a heart a many a time
But you'll never break this heart of mine
You broke a heart a many a time
But you'll never break this heart of mine

I'm a fish outta water
A soup in a basket
Gotta get to where I'm going
But don't know how to ask it

Believed in a young man
That's where I went wrong
And now I'm in the gutter
And I ain't got long

He was a callous boy
That much I could see
But the heart's a crazy fool
When it wants to believe
It loses all directions
Forgets how to drive
That honey saw me coming
And skinned me alive

You broke a heart a many a time
But you'll never break this heart of mine
You broke a heart a many a time
But you'll never break this heart of mine

You broke a heart a many a time
But you'll never break this heart of mine
You broke a heart a many a time
But you'll never break this heart of mine
