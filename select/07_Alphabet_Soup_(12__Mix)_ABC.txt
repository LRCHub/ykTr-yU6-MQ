Hit me one time
Hit me twice

The power's coming
The power's coming
The pen is mightier than the sword
You're gonna hear my vocal cords

In the beginning there was low Tec
In the beginning there was high Tec
In the beginning there was discotheque

We know what's good
We know what's bad
We know what's supper bad

In the beginning there was rhythm
In the beginning there was drums
In the beginning there was bass man

Perfect rhythm is the sign of a true thoroughbred
Meet drum aristocrat Mr. David Robinson
A sucker
A sucker for syncopation

Let your fingers do the walkin'
Let mister bass man do the talkin'
The sound you are hearing in the background
Is the sound of mister bass man and his bass too
Mister Bizz and his alphabet
The sound of plastic and elastic
That put the whole alphabetical soup together
Umm taste nice

Am I right or am I wrong
You'll find this mark where the beat goes on
6 strings at his disposal
60's soul in his whole low
Mr. Mark White
City light, tonight, and every night

Hit me hit me hit me
I'm swimming against the tide

Now sax equal sex equal sax
Which makes Stephen pornographic
Telephone hmm? Saxophone whoa

Go go go go
Listen listen listen
Hit me good hit me good
Take it down

Let's not forget the guy who rhyems moon whith tune
And croons with?
Let the golden throat preacher
And the golden teach ya
Presenting Mr. Martin Fry
Hit me

The power

If you can't stand the heat
Get out of the kitchen
Can't stand the fire
Go too
If you can't stand the heat
Get out of the kitchen
Can't stand the fire
Go too

It's coming again
So hit me with some power
So hit me with some power
Sock me
